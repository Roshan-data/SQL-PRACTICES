    "Understanding ON UPDATE CASCADE and ON DELETE SET NULL\n",
    "\n",
    " When you define a foreign key in MySQL, you can specify what should happen to\n",
    " the child table when the parent table is updated or deleted. These are called \n",
    " referential actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ON UPDATE CASCADE\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: If the value in the parent table (i.e., the referenced column) is updated,\n",
    " the corresponding foreign key value in the child table is automatically updated to\n",
    " match.\n",
    "\n",
    " Example: Suppose we update a class_id in the classes table:\n",
    "\n",
    " UPDATE classes SET class_id = 10 WHERE class_id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    " Then all students in the students table whose class_id was 1 will automatically be updated to 10 .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ON DELETE SET NULL\n",
    "\n",
    " Definition: If a row in the parent table is deleted, the foreign key in the child table\n",
    " will be set to NULL for all matching rows.\n",
    "                    \n",
    " Example: If we delete a class from the classes table:\n",
    "\n",
    "  DELETE FROM classes WHERE class_id = 2;\n",
    "\n",
    " Then all students in the students table who were in class 2 will have their class_id set to NULL , \n",
    " indicating that they are no longer assigned to a class."

    "Why Use These Options?\n",
